This project focuses on predicting car prices based on various features using multiple regression techniques. Multiple regression allows us to explore the relationship between several independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (car price).

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains information on various cars.

Car.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
data.csv: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing.
Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using pip:

Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Car_price_prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd car-price-prediction
Open and run the Jupyter notebook Car_price_prediction.ipynb:

Copy code
jupyter notebook Car_price_prediction.ipynb
